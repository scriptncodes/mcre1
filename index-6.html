If you subscribe to one of our mailing lists, we generally collect your name, email address, and optionally your telephone or other information if you provide it to us so we can customize your experience and better serve your needs.</p>
<p>In order to serve our customers, we collect personally identifiable information, like names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and sometimes credit card information when such information is voluntarily submitted by our visitors. Most of your customer information is stored in Clickbank, and not directly on our servers. Your credit card information is not stored by us, and is handled according to the procedures explained in the Section entitled: &#8220;Third Party Financial Institutions and Affiliates&#8221;.</p>

<p>We may communicate with you in response to any of your inquiries or requests, to provide you with recommendations or reports, or to alert you to new products and service offerings. We may do so by sending you emails, cell phone text messages, or placing telephone calls to you.

However, please be assured that this aggregated data will in no way personally identify you or any other visitors to any of our Websites, including this Website.</p>

<p>In the event of a complaint, we may also receive personally identifiable information about you from other subscribers of our Websites or from other users or third parties who may communicate information to us about you in relation to that complaint.</p>
<p><strong>B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>We also collect non-personally identifiable information about you to help us make your experience more enjoyable, to measure site activity to identify future improvements that should be made, and compile aggregate data to help serve site visitors better. For example, we may use session and persistent &#8220;cookies,&#8221; session logs, web beacons, GIF/pixel tags, banner ads, third-party click tracking analytics tools (such as Google Analytics), third party retargeting networks that may display our advertisements to you on other sites that you visit to remind you about us, and third party networks that serve user-requested emails (e.g., for a refer-a-friend email) to collect non-personally identifiable or other aggregated information about site visitors.</p>
<p>Cookies are text files that are used by your computer&#8217;s web browser to store your preferences, and enable us to enhance your user experience with our Websites. Third party retargeting networks may also use cookies to display our advertisements to you on other sites. You can learn more about opting-out of a third-party vendor&#8217;s use of cookies by visiting the <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page</a><u></u></p>
<p>Please note that you do have the option to configure most web browsers to NOT accept cookies. However, be aware that disabling cookies may keep you from having access to some functions or services on our Website or the web-hosted software that runs on our Website.</p>
<p>Emails or newsletters that we send electronically may use techniques such as web beacons or pixel tags to gather email metrics and information to improve the reader&#8217;s experience, such as the number of emails that are opened, whether they were forwarded or printed, the type of device from which they were opened, and the location (e.g. city, state, and county) associated with the applicable IP address.</p>
<p>Other parties such as advertising partners and analytics companies may also be collecting information about your online activity across various websites over time. The information collected by those third parties may include identifiers that allow those third parties to tailor the ads that they serve to your computer or other device.</p>
<p>If you visit this Website or any of our other Websites with an open ID (such as Facebook), you may also be sharing and integrating data with third-party social media sites, and we may track aggregate data about the number of visits to this Website or any of our other Websites with an open ID, the number of items &#8220;liked&#8221; on this Website or any of our other Websites, or items on this Website or any of our other Websites that you choose to share with a third-party social media site.</p>
<p>Other parties such as advertising partners and analytics companies may also be collecting information about your online activity across various websites over time. The information collected by those third parties may include identifiers that allow those third parties to tailor the ads that they serve to your computer or other device.</p>
<p>Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret web browser-based &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; signals other than cookies, we do not currently respond to &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; signals that are undefined. We are waiting for the online industry to develop a common protocol for how to treat DNT signals. In the meantime, you can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including those described herein.</p>
<p><strong>2. Third Party Financial Institutions and Affiliates</strong></p>
<p>We submit payment information directly to Clickbank when you purchase e-books on our Websites. This information includes your credit card or debit card number and your zip code. Clickbank may use this information to process your order and record and file the information. If you return purchased products or request a refund or exchange, you may be asked to give your name, address and any other identifiable information that is deemed necessary to verify your identity. This information may be collected by Clickbank to prevent fraud and identify theft.</p>
<p><strong>3. VeriPurchase</strong></p>
<p>VeriPurchase uses information collected from our customers through ClickBank in order to display in the VeriPurchase Customer Widget.

When a survey is sponsored by a third party, non-personally identifiable aggregated information of the survey results is reported to the sponsor. Personally identifiable information collected through market research will be used only by us and our service providers and contractors and will not be given or sold to a third party without your consent or as otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy. We will not knowingly accept survey responses from or conduct interviews with any person under the age of 18.</p>

<p>Sponsors or advertisers on our Websites may use their own cookies or other online tracking technologies in the advertisements served on our Websites and in emails, special promotions or newsletters you agree to have sent to you as a result of submitting your email address any of our Websites. Some advertisers use companies other than Gold Vida, LLC to serve their ads and to monitor users&#8217; responses to ads, and these companies (&#8220;Ad Servers&#8221;) may also collect non-personal information through the use of cookies or web beacons on our Websites. In certain situations, information collection may be facilitated by momentarily directing your browser to the website of an Ad Server or other third party acting on behalf of the sponsor, partner, or advertiser before re-directing your browser to its selected area. You should be aware that we do not and cannot control the use of cookies by advertisers or any information advertisers may gather from their use of cookies.</p>
