Non-Personally Identifiable Information<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We also collect non-personally identifiable information about you to help us make your experience more enjoyable, to measure site activity to identify future improvements that should be made, and compile aggregate data to help serve site visitors better. For example, we may use session and persistent &#8220;cookies,&#8221; session logs, web beacons, GIF\/pixel tags, banner ads, third-party click tracking analytics tools (such as Google Analytics), third party retargeting networks that may display our advertisements to you on other sites that you visit to remind you about us, and third party networks that serve user-requested emails (e.g., for a refer-a-friend email) to collect non-personally identifiable or other aggregated information about site visitors.<\/p>\n<p>Cookies are text files that are used by your computer&#8217;s web browser to store your preferences, and enable us to enhance your user experience with our Websites. Third party retargeting networks may also use cookies to display our advertisements to you on other sites. You can learn more about opting-out of a third-party vendor&#8217;s use of cookies by visiting the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.networkadvertising.org\/managing\/opt_out.asp\">Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page<\/a><u><\/u><\/p>\n<p>Please note that you do have the option to configure most web browsers to NOT accept cookies. However, be aware that disabling cookies may keep you from having access to some functions or services on our Website or the web-hosted software that runs on our Website.<\/p>\n<p>Emails or newsletters that we send electronically may use techniques such as web beacons or pixel tags to gather email metrics and information to improve the reader&#8217;s experience, such as the number of emails that are opened, whether they were forwarded or printed, the type of device from which they were opened, and the location (e.g. city, state, and county) associated with the applicable IP address.<\/p>\n<p>Other parties such as advertising partners and analytics companies may also be collecting information about your online activity across various websites over time. The information collected by those third parties may include identifiers that allow those third parties to tailor the ads that they serve to your computer or other device.<\/p>\n<p>If you visit this Website or any of our other Websites with an open ID (such as Facebook), you may also be sharing and integrating data with third-party social media sites, and we may track aggregate data about the number of visits to this Website or any of our other Websites with an open ID, the number of items &#8220;liked&#8221; on this Website or any of our other Websites, or items on this Website or any of our other Websites that you choose to share with a third-party social media site.<\/p>\n<p>Other parties such as advertising partners and analytics companies may also be collecting information about your online activity across various websites over time.

We are waiting for the online industry to develop a common protocol for how to treat DNT signals.
